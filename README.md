### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm the lead solution architect for Northwestern's in-house software development group. I'm a big PHP & Laravel shill, but I also work in JS, Java, HCL, and Ruby.

On this account, you'll mostly find personal projects, talk repos, websites, and other small assorted projects. I've got a couple packages you might find interesting under the university orgs:

- [OpenAM Duo MFA Node](https://github.com/NUIT-ISO/duo-universal-prompt-auth-node), implementing their v4 SDK and powering *every single login at the whole university*
- [Dynamic Forms for Laravel](https://github.com/NIT-Administrative-Systems/dynamic-forms), implementing a self-hosted PHP back-end for the [formiojs](https://github.com/formio/formio.js/) builder & renderer

#### What's New?
